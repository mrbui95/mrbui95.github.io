        <h1 class="title">iPhone, iPad update will detect and report child sexual abuse images</h1>
        <div class="body">
            <p>Apple on Thursday announced new features that will scan iPhone and iPad users' photos to detect and
                report
                large collections of child sexual abuse images that are stored on their cloud servers.
            </p>
            <p>"We want to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them,
                and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)," Apple said in a statement announcing the
                updates.
            </p>

            <p>"This program is ambitious, and protecting children is an important responsibility. Our efforts will
                evolve
                and expand over time."
            </p>
            <p>
                Apple said the detection work happens on the device and insisted that only people who have large
                collections
                of images uploaded to iCloud that match a database of known child sexual abuse material would cross a
                threshold that enables some of their photos to be decrypted and analyzed by Apple.
            </p>
            <p>Noting that possessing CSAM "is an illegal act," Apple's Chief Privacy Officer Erik Neuenschwander said
                on a
                press call Thursday that "the system was designed and trained" to detect images from the National Center
                for
                Missing and Exploited Children's CSAM database.
            </p>
            <p>Neuenschwander said people whose images are flagged to law enforcement would not be notified, but their
                accounts would be disabled.
            </p>
            <p>"The fact that your account is disabled is a noticeable act to you," Neuenschwander said.
            </p>
            <p>Apple said their suite of mobile device operating systems will be updated with the new child safety
                feature
                "later this year."
